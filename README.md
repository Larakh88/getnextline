# get_next_line

## Summary:
The get_next_line project challenges students to implement a function that reads a line from a file descriptor. This function, **`get_next_line`**, not only adds a convenient tool to a programmer's arsenal but also introduces them to the concept of static variables in C programming. By completing this project, I gained valuable experience in handling file input/output and memory management.

## Usage:
To utilize the **`get_next_line`** function in your projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Include the **`get_next_line.h`** header file in your source code.
3. Call the **`get_next_line()`** function in your code, passing the file descriptor you want to read from as an argument.
